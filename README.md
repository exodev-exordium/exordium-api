# Exordium (Rest API)

The Exordium API is used for https://exordium.org/ and https://clients.exordium.org/ and the respective desktop and mobile apps as well. 
## Prelude

Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works. **Our goal is to donate all profits made from the VPN towards environmental protection, and to fight against the climate crisis.**

We hope to share as much of our programming as open source code to help others create their own projects and further the development of software built with `electronjs` and `nodejs`, which are the fundamental pieces to us.

## API Progress

Currently the API is designed using nodejs and expressjs, however we are currently planning on translating the project into typescript so it matches with our file formats for our other projects.

At the current moment our `js` api has the following progress completed;
- [x] Public
