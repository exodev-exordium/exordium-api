# Exordium (Rest API)

*Developed by the Exordium Development Team*

This project was originally started using `Apollo GraphQL` but we ran into too many issues with the mobile app, and desktop application integration and decided it would be in our best interest to just use a plain and simple REST API.

## Prelude

Exordium is a virtual private networking software in the works. **Our goal is to donate all profits made from the VPN towards environmental protection, and to fight against the climate crisis.**

We hope to share as much of our programming as open source code to help others create their own projects and further the development of software built with `electronjs` and `nodejs`, which are the fundamental pieces to us.

## API

The current features that are in the works for the system;
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] User Management
- [ ] Server Management
- [ ] Blog/Post Management
